I decided it was time to give blogging another try.  I think it's good for me to have a place to post the things I am working on.  Right now it's photography, generative art, and trying to build a staticly served blog using [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com) that I am interested in. At other times I lean more towards visualization, finance, programming or writing.

I recently saw an old video by Ze Frank about unexecuted ideas being "[Brain Crack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sHCQWjTrJ8)" which inspired me to get something out in the world.  I defintely have to much brain crack floating around in my head.  This is a start at least on getting some of those things out of my head although the backlog is considerable.
