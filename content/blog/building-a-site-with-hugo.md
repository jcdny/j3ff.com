Here's an outline of what I went through to build this blog.  You can
see the live code at [github](http://github.com/jcdny/j3ff.com).

* Fork, checkout, and build [Hugo](http://github.com/spf13/hugo) to do the site generation.
* Create a [github repo for this site](http://github.com/jcdny/j3ff.com).
* Cargo cult the basic file structure and templates from [spf13.com](https://github.com/spf13/spf13.com) and [xaprb.com](https://github.com/xaprb/xaprb.com).
* Generate the basic site markup from [Initializr.com](http://www.initializr.com/).
* Set up a [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) account to get basic site statistics.
* Set up a [Disqus](http://disqus.com/websites/) account for comments.
